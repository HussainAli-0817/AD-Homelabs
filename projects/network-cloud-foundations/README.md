# Project Case: Network And Cloud Support Foundations

## Purpose

This project consolidates earlier networking and AWS learning into one recruiter-friendly support case. It is not the main IAM portfolio piece, but it supports help desk readiness by showing TCP/IP, routing, firewall/security group, and cloud networking awareness.

## Role Relevance

Help desk and junior support roles often touch network symptoms even when they are not network engineering roles. This project shows practice with:

- DHCP and static IP troubleshooting.
- IP conflict diagnosis.
- Ping and connectivity testing.
- AWS VPC, subnet, route table, internet gateway, security group, and NACL concepts.
- Public versus private network paths.

## Support Ticket Mapping

| Ticket Scenario | Troubleshooting Focus |
| --- | --- |
| User cannot reach internal app | DNS, route, firewall, security group, endpoint status |
| VM cannot ping another host | IP address, subnet, firewall, NACL, security group |
| Website unreachable | HTTP rule, route table, public IP, service status |
| VPN or cloud access issue | Network path, identity group, conditional access, device state |

## What To Add Next

- Add a ticket-style case: "user cannot reach internal web app."
- Include commands used, such as `ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, `Test-NetConnection`, or AWS console checks.
- Document root cause and resolution.
- Keep cloud IDs sanitized and avoid exposing live public DNS names.
